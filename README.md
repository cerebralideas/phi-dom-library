Phi Polyfill
===============

A polyfill library for phi.

## Needed features:

- [x] A fallback for Object.create(): [MDN Object.create()](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object/create)
- [ ] A fallback for classList: a way of adding, toggling and removing class or classes from a DOM element.
- [ ] A fallback for hasClass, the jQuery method for testing the existance of a class.
- [ ] A fallback for accessing data attributes from a DOM element.
- [ ] A fallback for handling stopPropogation and preventDefault. Josh has already done some work in this area; see his overlay.js.
- [ ] A more jQuery way of selecting elements. Just wrapping the native getElementById, getElementsByTagName and [querySelectorAll](http://ejohn.org/blog/thoughts-on-queryselectorall/). Just test for the existance of a hash, a dot and just alphanumeric to know which to use.
- [ ] A fallback for event listeners: .click()
- [ ] A fallback for event delegation (think jQuery's .on() method).

- [jQuery itself will be a great resource](http;//jquery.com), you could really just cherry pick their code right out of their library to save a ton of time.
